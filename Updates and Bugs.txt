Known Bugs:

If a user unplugs their pc controller after the program started, global crash.
MAME arcade implementation is still weak. High probability of global crash.
On the emulation data collection form, misclicks around the listboxes will cause form crashes.
Lots of empty menu items (delete rom, add rom, etc.)

Plans:

Add more emulation support through command line args--research controller mapping in the command line for each console
Work out Atari 2600 emulation
Work out Nintendo emulation
Add more cartridge-based systems, n64, Master, etc.
Fill out a lot more of the database for each system (I have about 10-25 for Genesis, SNES, and NES only right now)
Fix GUI. Get some professional design help.
Cut out sprites for a lot of those things in the databases
Add animation for sprites
Maybe write an auto-updater (find web space) to prevent constant reinstallations

Distant Plans:

Support ISO-based and CD-based systems, playstation, Saturn, PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube, etc.
Expand databases to include most roms on all systems
Include encryption and compression to keep data safer and try to keep app size down
